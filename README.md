Our Trello Board:  https://trello.com/b/Wu9FgMPP/9th-age-website
When we create branches, we use this convention: [cardnumber from trello]-name_of_branch
The cardnumber is a number stated on all trello cards. The name of the branch should be describing what you are doing, such as "hover_effect_army_imgs".
