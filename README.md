# 9thageproto
Github project for new landingsite for the 9th Age.

If you want to play along at home:
* You need to have an apache2 server, I recommend xampp (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
* Clone the repo into ../xampp/htdocs/
* Install Ruby (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Install SASS (https://medium.com/@ricardozea/sass-for-beginners-the-friendliest-guide-about-how-to-install-use-sass-on-windows-22ff4a32c1f7)
* Fire up the apache server (from the control panel UI in windows, or by sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start in the terminal on mac or linux)
